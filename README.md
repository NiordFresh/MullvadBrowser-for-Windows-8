# Mullvad Browser for Windows 8+

Mullvad Browser is a privacy-focused web browser developed in collaboration with the Tor Project to minimize fingerprinting. It is available for free and does not require a Mullvad VPN subscription to function.

Mullvad Browser 14.5.6 (based on Firefox 128.14.0 ESR) is the last version to officially support Windows 8/8.1. This repository provides a newer, patched version of Mullvad Browser, allowing users to continue using the latest features and security fixes.
